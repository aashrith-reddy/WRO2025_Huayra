Engineering materials - Huayra
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2025.

## Content

* `team_photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `vehicle_photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `component_code` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `wro_designs` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction

We are Huayra, a new team emerging from Roboprenr in Bangalore. A lot of development is still underway as we optimize our ideas quite frequenetly, but currently our robot has the current systems:
1) Motor & Steering
2) Power
3) Microprocessor (raspberry pi) and Camera
4) Collision prevention system with IR sensors

More information coming soon!
