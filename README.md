## Introduction
The **WRO2025_Huayra** project is a submission for the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) 2025 under the Future Engineers category. This initiative challenges participants to design, build, and program a self-driving vehicle that can navigate a dynamic environment autonomously. The project integrates mechanical design, embedded systems, and software engineering to create a robust autonomous platform.
This report outlines the technical architecture, design methodology, software implementation, and theoretical underpinnings of the vehicle developed by Team Huayra.

## Project / Bot Description  
Our robot features a **rigid metal chassis reinforced with precision 3D-printed components**, ensuring durability. At its core, a **Raspberry Pi 5** orchestrates real-time processing for **laser sensors, a camera module, and a servo-driven steering system**, enabling highly accurate navigation and control. Its **low ground clearance, inspired by Formula 1 engineering principles, enhances stability and downforce**, ensuring superior performance during high-speed maneuvers. Designed with precision and reliability this platform is built to excel in the **WRO Future Engineers competition**.
