## Project / Bot Description  
Our robot features a **rigid metal chassis reinforced with precision 3D-printed components**, ensuring durability. At its core, a **Raspberry Pi 5** orchestrates real-time processing for **laser sensors, a camera module, and a servo-driven steering system**, enabling highly accurate navigation and control. Its **low ground clearance, inspired by Formula 1 engineering principles, enhances stability and downforce**, ensuring superior performance during high-speed maneuvers. Designed with precision and reliability this platform is built to excel in the **WRO Future Engineers competition**.
